                                that thrives originated from a mere trend of internet usage. As a result, it is now believed that small businesses having a website tend to have a&nbsp;40%&nbsp;faster

                                    the following benefits:<strong>Enhanced forecasting ability.</strong>&nbsp;If you are able to understand the current trends and predict the future ones surrounding your business, forecasting the future of your business will
                                    be a lot easier for you.

                                    If you know all about the current and future business trends, you can compare with them your current strategies. Anything that does not match must be improved. This way the business trends become a reliable guide for determining

Following are the areas where technology trend awareness skills play their significant role:<strong>Enhancing your visibility to the customers</strong>.
                                            According to an estimate, more than&nbsp;<a href="http://perq.com/entrepreneurs-aware-tech-trends-even-business-isnt-tech/">2 billion</a>&nbsp;people use their mobile devices for internet access. Technology has been
                                            absorbed in everyone’s lives to the extent that every day we all interact with one kind of screen or another, mostly using internet. Therefore, your customers could be anywhere using any kind of technology. Technology
                                            trend awareness helps you identify what your customers are mostly spending their time with so that you can connect with them easily. For instance, if it’s their mobile devices they prefer to use, have you pondered over
                                            how your website looks in mobile format?<strong>Increasing opportunities with new ideas and new ventures</strong>. Technology trend awareness doesn’t necessarily help with marketing alone. It increases opportunities
                                            to improve other areas as well. ‘Lean manufacturing’ is a good example of improvements through technology trend awareness skills. you can adopt new and trending technologies without necessarily having a technology-centric
                                            business, or start a new technology-centric venture, all for the sake of additional revenue opportunities.<br><br></p>

                      their full part in society. This is true because the internet has come to occupy such a central role in our lives as a way of connecting and as a means to access services; particularly since the advent of smartphones and other mobile
                      devices which make it possible to access the internet pretty much anywhere. At the same time, organisations have become so reliant on internet-based models of delivery that many services are now difficult or even impossible to access
                      if you don’t have the internet. This includes key services like banking and even<a href="http://www.litrg.org.uk/sites/default/files/digital_exclusion_-_litrg_report.pdf"><strong>state-run public services</strong></a>.However,
                      we may only have seen the merest glimpse of the future takeover of our lives by technology. The next generation of interfaces that allow us to access the internet are likely to look very different from the screen-based ones we are
                      used to today. There will be a huge growth in non-visual, conversation-based interfaces (along the lines of Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Home or Microsoft’s Cortana) which are driven by AI. There will also be virtual reality
                      interfaces, which enable the user to interact with the internet from within a computer-generated world and augmented reality interfaces, which overlay elements of these virtual worlds onto the real world.Each of these will bring their
                      own specific problems (which we shall consider further below), but in general terms they will also become so deeply entangled in the fabric of our everyday existence that to lose access to them or to lack the requisite skills to harness
                      them will cause massive disenfranchisement. Civil society organisations will increasingly find themselves having to fight for the rights of people who are being marginalised by exclusion via technology, and trying to overcome the challenges
                      they face.<br><br><div id="p2"></div><strong>2 EXCLUSION FROM TECHNOLOGY: HEALTH ISSUES:--</strong><br><br>Loss of access to technology that you have come to rely on is not just a rights issue: there is a growing body of evidence that it can cause symptoms
                      of actual physical harm. For example, there are many studies showing that some people’s reliance on their mobile phones takes on the quality of an addiction (which has been pun-tastically dubbed “nomophobia”), and that they therefore
                      suffer withdrawal symptoms if it is taken away from them in the same way that a drug user would.Furthermore, an increasing number of people’s entire sense of identity and self is tied up with the ways in which they present themselves
                      online in various contexts, so losing access to the internet is tantamount to losing part of themselves. And again, the more that we become reliant on other technology, the more of a problem this is going to be.For health charities,
                      particularly those dealing with mental issues or with young people, this is likely to cause a whole slew of new challenges. They will be required to deal with the consequences of addiction in individual cases, but also to shape the
                      overall policy debate so that we can find ways to ensure that our relationship with technology does not become malign.<br><br><div id="p3"></div><strong>3- CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT:--</strong><br><br>There is growing concern that technological developments
                      are having<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/01/toddler-brains-research-smartphones-damage-social-development"><strong>a negative effect on the development of children</strong></a>. Of course, one always
                      has to be careful not to fall into the trap of thinking that ‘everything was better when I was growing up’ and thus imposing views based on rose-tinted nostalgia to today’s children. However, the sheer pace of change of technology
                      over the last two or three decades means that the world in which children are now growing up really does seem fundamentally different in many ways.Our understanding of how children develop has struggled to keep pace with this. For
                      example, we do not really know what effect use of touch screen technology from a very early age has on the development of motor skills, what impact the speed of information availability will have on attention spans, or what an increasingly
                      sedentary, indoor existence might mean for the general physical development of children. In each of these cases there seem to be justifiable causes for concern, and it seems certain that future technological developments will only
                      exacerbate these issues.Charities have always taken a leading role with respect to child development and welfare issues, and it is almost certain that they will have to do so when it comes to understanding and combatting the potential
                      developmental impacts of new technology.<div id="p4"></div><br><br><strong>4- LOSS OF REAL-WORLD SOCIAL SKILLS:-</strong><br><br>Spending large amounts of time within online or virtual environments may affect one’s behaviour and ability to function out
                      here in the real world. This could take a number of forms (which are explored in more detail in a fascinating paper called “<a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frobt.2016.00003/full"><strong>Real Virtuality: A Code of Ethical Conduct. Recommendations for Good Scientific Practice and the Consumers of VR-Technology</strong></a>”
                      by Michael Madary and Thomas Metzinger:<strong>Depersonalization/Derealisation Disorder</strong>: These are dissociative disorders in which a person has recurrent feelings of being ‘outside themselves’ observing
                      their own actions (depersonalization) or inside themselves but detached from their surroundings (derealisation). These are conditions that predate the invention of technologies such as VR, but there is evidence that long-term immersion
                      in virtual environments can trigger these conditions. (There is some obvious intuitive sense to this, as if you spend the majority of time in a world that you know in some way to be ‘unreal’ it would not be surprising if these feelings
                      continued even when you were back in the real world).<strong>Loss of empathy</strong>: VR technology can be used as a powerful tool to increase empathy, but it is also possible that it
                      could have the opposite effect if the unreality of virtual situations was constantly reinforced to the point where people became numbed to the feelings of others within the virtual environment and then carried this attitude into real-world

                      rely on in our interactions (e.g. facial expression, body language etc.) might be missing or different in a virtual environment. Those who spend large periods of time in these environments, particularly young people who do so during
                      important developmental phases, may fail to develop a proper understanding of these cues and thus find themselves less able to interact effectively with others in the real world.<strong>Loss of sense modalities</strong>: as well as social cues, there are other contextual elements of our real-world interactions that play a hugely important role in memory and understanding, and
                      which may be missing in virtual environments (e.g. smell, touch, external sounds etc.).sp; 
                      <strong>Active dislike/hatred of physical environment:</strong>One serious negative effect of spending
                      large periods of time in virtual environments may be that people develop an active hatred of the physical world. If you spend the majority of time in a virtual environment where you have been able to craft your identity carefully and
                      where you are comfortable with the rules and social mores, it is easy to see how the prospect of spending time in a real world where you are tied to your physical body and different rules apply (and where you may lack certain key social
                      skills, as outlined above) is going to be unappealing. This may produce feelings of anger and frustration and even lead to violence. We can see early forms of this sort of problem in the growing number of tragic cases of “gamer rage”
                      in which domestic violence incidents resulting in injury or even death are sparked by someone being interrupted while playing a video game.<div id="p5"></div><br><br><strong>5- ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE:-</strong><br><br>Even when many technologies make it
                      increasingly easy to escape the real world by going online or into a virtual environment, we have to remember that the hardware they rely on continues to exist here and as such has tangible environmental impacts. Many of these technologies
                      are extremely energy-intensive, and thus add to the demand for power generation (which currently still includes fossil fuels). Some also require constant cooling in order to absorb the vast amount of heat they generate, and often the
                      most effective way of doing this is to build gigantic facilities in very cold places, which also tend to be pristine natural environments; for example the Facebook data centre on the Arctic circle at Luleå.There is also the problem
                      that many pieces of technological hardware contain materials that are highly toxic so they need to be handled in particular ways when it comes to disposal or recycling. Unfortunately, the high cost of doing so means that a huge trade
                      has sprung up in illegal e-waste. Much of this makes its way to the developing world, where companies in countries with less strict regulation and enforcement can make vast sums by flouting safety rules.It is possible that technological
                      developments could mitigate some of the potential environmental damage caused by growing demand for technology. Revolutions in clean/renewable technology or battery technology could alleviate some of the concerns about power consumption
                      and generation. Likewise the advent of widespread, affordable 3D printing might do a lot to combat the problem of waste if it allowed people to print goods when they needed them and then easily &nbsp;recycle them into component parts
                      for reprinting. It will all depend whether these technologies keep pace with the technologies that are going to generate the increased demand<div id="p6"></div>.<br><br><strong>6- INEQUALITY:-</strong><br><br>Widening income inequality is one of the
                      defining issues of our time, and a causal factor in many other social issues. So an important question about many of the new technological developments that are predicted to shape our future is: will they increase or decrease inequality
                      within society?<strong><em>An important question about many of the new technological developments that are predicted to shape our future is: will they increase or decrease inequality within our society?</em></strong><br>Technologies
                      such as the internet or mobile phones are often argued to have had a democratising effect, and this is surely true to some extent:&nbsp; a child in rural India can now get free access to courses from some of the world’s top educational
                      institutions, while a farmer in Sub-Saharan Africa can use a mobile phone to access information that ensures he is able to get a fair price for his crops and banking services that allow him to accept and make payments easily. However,
                      whilst some people are definitely enfranchised by technology, there are also those who lose out. Older people, for instance, often lack the skills to use new technology and as a result may find themselves left behind as more and more
                      products and services comes to rely on those technologies.In the future, the divide between the technological haves and have-nots could become enormous. As automation replaces many traditional jobs, a divide might also open up between
                      those who no longer work and those who are still able to work, or even own the technology. A country-level divide could also open up between those countries that are able to take advantage of this “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/"><strong>fourth industrial revolution</strong></a>”
                      and those that cannot, so there would be a widening of global inequality between the ‘technologically developed’ and ‘technologically developing’ world. This could then lead to further inequality as the environmental impacts of our
                      increased reliance on technology are shared out unequally; with the developing world becoming a power station to meet the energy needs of the developed world or a dumping ground for waste materials.Hopefully this doesn’t all sound
                      too apocalyptic or dystopian! I’m fundamentally very optimistic about the potential for technology to drive huge improvements in the way we address social challenges and also to transform the ways in which people are able to support
                      causes. That is why one of our key themes at Giving Thought is “<a href="https://www.cafonline.org/about-us/blog-home/giving-thought/the-future-of-doing-good"><strong>the future of doing good</strong></a>”, and we will continue to
                      explore new technologies in order to understand their impact on philanthropy and the work of charities.However, I do believe that blind optimism is just as bad as cynicism. It is crucial that we think through the negative consequences
                      of technological developments instead of just buying into the often over-inflated hype, as that way we stand a better chance of ensuring that if these things do come to pass, they will do far more good than harm and benefit the many
                      rather than the few.<div id="p7"></div><br><strong>7-PRIVACY:-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br>Traditional
                      concepts of privacy — our right to be left alone — and the basic principle that the content of our communications should remain confidential — are being challenged and eroded with advancements in digital technology. Similarly, the
                      fundamental principle that individuals should be able to control when their personal data is collected by third parties and how it is used is nearly impossible to implement in a world where personal data is collected, created, used,
                      processed, analyzed, shared, transferred, copied, and stored in unprecedented ways and at an extraordinary speed and volume. This includes the collection and creation of unprecedented volumes of personal data from an ever-increasing
                      number of connected devices - smartphones, smartwatches, other wearable devices, smart toys, connected cars, drones, personal assistants like the Amazon echo, etc. This Internet of Things -- the network of physical objects, or “things,”
                      embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable objects to collect and exchange data -- is expected to expand from an estimated 8.4 billion devices in 2017 to a projected 20.4 billion in 2020.<br><br>There
                      will be no opting out of this data-intensive world. Technology and sharing personal information will indispensible to participation in modern society. Internet access and use of new digital technologies will be necessary for employment,
                      education, access to benefits, and full participation in economic and civic life.So what happens to our personal data, identity, reputation, and privacy in this digital, connected world? Unclear. Our privacy laws in the United States
                      are based on antiquated notions of notice and choice, and are completely inadequate to address this rapid evolution in technology, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Although Congress is now debating new Federal privacy
                      legislation, I’m not optimistic that policymakers will be able to craft a law that will address these issues in a meaningful way — if they can create any law at all. There are too many stakeholders involved in the debate, each protecting
                      their own economic self interest and competitive advantage in the marketplace. And the issues are complex. Add to this the pathetic fact that companies in 2019 can’t seem to protect or secure any data, much less our sensitive personal
                      data.<br><br>That said, we’re making progress. A series of high profile scandals in 2018 have ignited the privacy debate and put a spotlight on irresponsible business practices. Trust in the tech giants like Facebook is way down, and
                      consumer frustration is way up. Despite my pessimism about the prospect for a federal privacy law, our policymakers are taking this debate seriously and exploring a wide range of solutions. Some of these are even meaningful solutions.
                      On top of that, individuals do have some control over our online privacy, identity, and reputation. We need to engage more, make better informed decisions, use privacy settings and tools, and hold companies accountable when they misuse
                      our data and violate our trust. New privacy laws in Europe and California are advancing this debate, and new technologies are being developed to help individuals better protect their privacy.As we debate privacy, we also shouldn’t
                      forget that all of this new tech produces enormous benefits for our society - from curing diseases to easing traffic and reducing pollution. The question before us is, can we promote innovation and the many benefits of the Fourth Industrial
                      Revolution while limiting the potential harm to society, including the loss of privacy and individual autonomy? I’m not sure, but I plan to keep fighting to protect our privacy, online and offline<div id="p8"></div>.<br><strong>8-DIGITAL DIPLOMACY:-</strong><br><br>Cyber
                      espionage, cyber-attacks, hacktivism, internet censorship and even supposedly technical issues such as net neutrality are now making the headlines on a regular basis. Cyberspace has become a contested political space, shaped by diverging
                      interests, norms and values. As a result of this politicization, diplomats have entered the game. If cyberspace was once a domain for technical discussions among IT specialists only, that era is definitively over.The role of diplomacy
                      in cyberspace is much less prominent in the media than stories of cyber incidents. A notable exception was the 2015 cybersecurity deal reached between the US and China, one of the most contentious issue in their bilateral relations.
                      For years, both sides had accused each other of network infiltration and of stealing confidential information from companies and government agencies. The US had accused China of stealing or compromising a number of weapon systems,
                      such as the F-35 and the PAC3 missile (Meyer,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/ZhwRdgs8zy27S344cuUX/full#">2015</a>). In 2014, five Chinese hackers were indicted by the Department of Justice over hacking into a number
                      of high-profile companies, such as the United States Steel Corporation (Segal,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/ZhwRdgs8zy27S344cuUX/full#">2016</a>). China has often responded with counter-claims of being a victim
                      of US intrusions (Singer &amp; Friedman,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/ZhwRdgs8zy27S344cuUX/full#">2014</a>, p. 189). The agreement struck between President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping foresees cooperation
                      and mutual assistance in investigations on cybercrime, while both sides committed to restrain from cyber-enabled economic espionage. A monitoring mechanism was established to ensure the proper implementation of this agreement, and
                      a hotline was created to deal with the escalation of issues in cyberspace (White House,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/ZhwRdgs8zy27S344cuUX/full#">2015</a>).<br><br>Cyber-diplomacy can be defined as diplomacy in the
                      cyber domain or, in other words, the use of diplomatic resources and the performance of diplomatic functions to secure national interests with regard to the cyberspace. Such interests are generally identified in national cyberspace
                      or cybersecurity strategies, which often include references to the diplomatic agenda. Predominant issues on the cyber-diplomacy agenda include cybersecurity, cybercrime, confidence-building, internet freedom and internet governance.<br><br>As
                      established earlier in this article, the activities of cyber-diplomacy shift significantly between international and world societies. More importantly, they operate with concepts, technologies and practices that more often than not
                      were defined within the realm of the latter. It is now, in this concluding section, important to return to this discussion in order to sediment the definition of cyber-diplomacy.In the last few decades there has been, following Barry
                      Hall (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/ZhwRdgs8zy27S344cuUX/full#">2014</a>, pp. 165–166), a marked tendency to increase the level of interaction between international society and world society asPeople everywhere now understand
                      that they are embedded in a single global economy (like it or not), and up to a point that they are also embedded in a single global culture and a single global environment (again, like it or not).Although “[t]here isn’t a ready-made
                      cosmopolitan alternative to the states-system”, Buzan believes “there is increasing interplay and in some ways merger between the different pluralisms in the interstate and world society domains” (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/ZhwRdgs8zy27S344cuUX/full#">2014</a>,
                      p. 166). Indeed, many of the norms that regulate and give legitimacy to international society developed from world society (Clark,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/ZhwRdgs8zy27S344cuUX/full#">2007</a>, p. 13).Cyberspace
                      activities have mostly been conducted following a world society rationale best captured by the so-called multi-stakeholder model governing the internet, although states are now trying to come to terms with the importance of the field
                      by incorporating it into the international society realm. All this, without excluding the realist international system, the sphere in which states co-exist and interact without a concern for shared values or norms. Whereas cases such
                      as the July 2016 Democratic National Committee hacking evidence that state activity in cyberspace is still very much determined by strategic (rather than normative) considerations (the realm of the international system), it is the
                      aim of cyber-diplomacy to progressively shift those behaviours and attitudes towards a space of peaceful co-existence, defined by clear rules and principles: from a system of interactive units to a society of states. In that regard,
                      cyber-diplomacy is to cyberspace what diplomacy is to IR: a fundamental pillar of international society.<div id="p9"></div><br><strong>9-AI AND ECONOMY:-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br><strong>1. AI Bias</strong>Since
                      AI algorithms are built by humans, they can have&nbsp;<a href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/machine-learning-bias-algorithm-bias-or-AI-bias">built-in bias</a>&nbsp;by those who either intentionally or inadvertently
                      introduce them into the algorithm. If AI algorithms are built with a bias or the data in the training sets they are given to learn from is biassed, they will produce results that are biassed. This reality could lead to unintended consequences
                      like the ones we have seen with discriminatory recruiting algorithms and Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot that became racist. As companies build AI algorithms, they need to be developed and trained responsibly.<br><strong>2. Loss of Certain Jobs</strong>While
                      many<a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/automation/30463/gartner-by-2020-ai-will-create-more-jobs-than-it-eliminates">&nbsp;jobs will be created by artificial intelligence</a>&nbsp;and many people predict a net increase in jobs or at

                      there will be jobs people do today that machines will take over. This will require changes to training and education programmes to prepare our future workforce as well as helping current workers transition to new positions that will
                      utilise their unique human capabilities.<br><strong>3. A shift in Human Experience</strong>If AI takes over menial tasks and allows humans to significantly reduce the amount of time they need to spend at a job, the extra freedom might
                      seem like a utopia at first glance. However, in order to feel their life has a purpose, humans will need to channel their newfound freedom into new activities that give them the same social and mental benefits that their job used to
                      provide. This might be easier for some people and communities than others. There will likely be economic considerations as well when machines take over responsibilities that humans used to get paid to do. The economic benefits of increased
                      efficiencies are pretty clear on the profit-loss statements of businesses, but the overall benefits to society and the human condition are a bit more opaque.<br><strong>4. Global Regulations</strong>While our world is a much smaller place
                      than ever before because of technology, this also means that AI technology that requires new laws and regulations will need to be determined among various governments to allow safe and effective global interactions. Since we are no
                      longer isolated from one another, the actions and decisions regarding artificial intelligence in one country could adversely affect others very easily. We are seeing this already playing out, where Europe has adopted a robust regulatory
                      approach to ensure consent and transparency, while the US and particularly China allows its companies to apply AI much more liberally.<br><strong>5. Accelerated Hacking</strong>Artificial intelligence increases the speed of what can be
                      accomplished and in many cases, it exceeds our ability as humans to follow along. With automation, nefarious acts such as phishing, delivery of viruses to software and taking advantage of AI systems because of the way they see the
                      world, might be difficult for humans to uncover until there is a real quagmire to deal with.<br><strong>6. AI Terrorism</strong>Similarly, there may be new AI-enabled form of terrorism to deal with: From the expansion of autonomous drones
                      and the introduction of robotic swarms to remote attacks or the delivery of disease through nanorobots. Our law enforcement and defence organisations will need to adjust to the potential threat these present.It will take time and extensive
                      human reasoning to determine the best way to prepare for a future with even more artificial intelligence applications to ensure that even though there is potential for adverse impacts with its further adoption, it is minimised as much
                      as possible.As is the case with any disruptive event, these aren’t easy situations to solve, but as long as we still have humans involved in determining solutions, we will be able to take advantage of the many benefits of artificial
                      intelligence while reducing and mitigating the negative impacts.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

                                out freely and develop the tone and voice of your posts to reflect that. People are much more likely to engage when the conversation feels casual. Plus, if you’re charismatic, your personality will help you gain followers.<strong>3. Use a different tone on different platforms</strong>On
                                Twitter, you can be much more playful than on LinkedIn. Facebook also calls for a different tone. Certain types of people use different social media channels, and for different reasons. LinkedIn, for example, being a professional

                                Cybersecurity Alliance suggest that many small business owners are still operating under a false sense of cyber security.The statistics of these studies are grim. The vast majority of U.S. small businesses lack a formal Internet
                                security policy for employees and only about half have even rudimentary cybersecurity measures in place. Furthermore, only about a quarter of small business owners have had an outside party test their computer systems to ensure
                                they are hacker proof and nearly 40 percent do not have their data backed up in more than one location.<strong> Don’t Equate Small with Safe </strong> despite significant cybersecurity exposures, 85 percent of small business owners
                                believe their company is safe from hackers, viruses, malware or a data breach. This disconnect is largely due to the widespread, albeit mistaken, belief that small businesses are unlikely targets for cyber attacks. In reality,
                                data thieves are simply looking for the path of least resistance. Symantec’s study found that 40 percent of attacks are against organizations with fewer than 500 employees.Outside sources like hackers aren’t the only way your
                                company can be attacked. Often smaller companies have a family-like atmosphere and put too much trust in their employees. This can lead to complacency, which is exactly what a disgruntled or recently fired employee needs to
                                execute an attack on the business.<strong> Attacks Could Destroy Your Business </strong>as large companies continue to get serious about data security, small businesses are becoming increasingly attractive targets—and the results
                                are often devastating for small business owners.According to the Kaspersky Lab, the average annual cost of cyber attacks to small and medium-sized businesses was over $200,000 in 2014. Most small businesses don’t have that
                                kind of money lying around and, as a result, nearly 60 percent of the small businesses victimized by a cyber attack close permanently within six months of the attack. Many of these businesses put off making necessary improvements
                                to their cyber security protocols until it was too late because they feared the costs would be prohibitive.<strong> Prevent Cyber Attacks </strong>even if you don’t currently have the resources to bring in an outside
                                expert to test your computer systems and make security recommendations, there are simple, economical steps you can take to reduce your risk of falling victim to a costly cyber attack:Train employees in cyber security principles.Install,

                                as they become available.Make backup copies of important business data and information.Control physical access to your computers and network components.Secure your Wi-Fi networks. If you have a Wi-Fi network for your workplace
                                make sure it is secure and hidden.Require individual user accounts for each employee.Limit employee access to data and information and limit authority to install software.Regularly change passwords.<br><br></p>

                            <p class="card-text">The internet was not designed with privacy and security at top of mind. It was built to spread information, not contain it, and has succeeded at this central objective in spectacular fashion. As the internet and digital economy
                                mature, however, privacy and security are now rising on the list of priorities for consumers and increasingly for policymakers as well.<br>Yesterday, several of the world’s biggest technology and internet companies&nbsp;
                                <a
                                    href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/9/examining-safeguards-for-consumer-data-privacy">testified</a>&nbsp;before the Senate Commerce Committee on a truly vexing question: how to harness the blessings of information abundance while simultaneously protecting against its misuse.Policymakers recited from a long list
                                    of data breaches over the past several years. They scolded some of the tech firms for intrusive web-tracking practices and badgered the firms on a range of loosely related complaints.It is true that a few of the tech firms
                                    deserve criticism. In a rush to innovate, some, especially those focused on advertising, displayed a cavalier attitude about consumer privacy for too long. Some also allowed political partisanship to bias their treatment
                                    of online content and internal management. These practices were short sighted, and the intense criticism is having a salutary effect. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, for example, just issued a company-wide directive against political
                                    bias, concluding that<strong>&nbsp;</strong>“if any Googler ever undermines that trust, we will hold them accountable.”The hearing focused on policy-centric approaches to the big privacy questions, and in the wake of the
                                    hearing, some senators will no doubt call for laws similar to Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or California’s new Consumer Privacy Act.&nbsp;Both are sweeping approaches to a fast-changing environment
                                    of commerce and culture. GDPR is already rippling through the digital world, for good and ill, and although California’s law doesn’t go into effect until 2020, the state’s internet firms are scrambling while outside firms
                                    are wondering how a single state (or continent) can hope to govern what is inherently interstate (or global) commerce.But imitating these laws would be bad for American technological leadership on the internet. Among their
                                    many flaws, the laws are overly prescriptive and don’t acknowledge two simple facts: First, the best fix for problems borne of technology is often . . . more technology. Second, the financial incentives to build products,
                                    services, and business models that protect consumer privacy are huge.The popularity of ad-blockers over the past few years is an obvious example, in which a simple technology helped consumers avoid unwanted web tracking.
                                    The Brave browser takes this idea to the next level and seeks to overturn the advertising-based browsing model altogether. In its place, it hopes to launch a browsing experience based on blockchain-powered micropayments.
                                    Who knows if Brave will succeed, but it’s an example of a competitive solution.Apple’s new iPhone XS improves on Face ID and its hardware-based key manager known as Secure Enclave. Of course, Apple would argue that, unlike
                                    the internet, it&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;built privacy and security into its products from the beginning&nbsp;— and that its trillion-dollar market cap reflects this attention to consumer preferences. Other large firms are
                                    now following its lead, offering consumers user-friendly choices about data sharing and implementing creative “pseudonymization” policies to mask identities from their&nbsp;corresponding information.Or consider the ways
                                    that AT&amp;T and Verizon are designing 5G wireless networks with privacy and security at their core. These firms are also central to the nation’s cybersecurity efforts, though much of their work goes purposely unmentioned.Startups,
                                    such as Very Good Security (VGS), are building new cloud services so that smaller firms across the economy can offer products with leading-edge privacy protection. VGS’s solution is to mediate — and anonymize — transactions,
                                    authorizations, and authentications so that our personal information is not stored and transmitted along the daisy chain of hospitals, retailers, online stores, and other points-of-sale, including all their vendors and
                                    vendors’ vendors.As we enter the next phase of the internet, the great promise is to spread information technology to the parts of the economy that have not yet fully exploited its amazing powers.&nbsp;As data collection,
                                    creation, and analysis become a more important part of other industries — such as health care and transportation — these privacy questions and policy challenges will multiply. Troves of genetic information and location
                                    data and video collected by vehicles, as just two examples, will radically improve health and safety. But these biological, location, and “surveillance” data are particularly sensitive and need protection. Because digital
                                    innovation in the “other 70 percent of the economy” is so important for overall economic growth, getting our privacy and security policies right is crucial for overall economic performance.<br></p>

                            <p class="card-text">Today, the primary concern of every industry is the laggy approach that sometimes affects the overall management of the operations. Therefore, industries are focusing more on the efficiency and the response rate of computing, through
                                which data analysis is made. And here comes the role of edge computing.&nbsp;Edge computing brings data storage and computation closer to the businesses, and hence, ameliorates the response times and saves bandwidth. Also,
                                it weighs more like the latest trend in technology because the industries are rapidly empowered with sophisticated and specialized resources, which is bound to reduce the latency.&nbsp;The primary advantages of Edge computing
                                includeEdge computing enhances the security to a new level by countering the issues of local compliance, privacy regulations, and data sovereignty. Although many believe that edge computing, in fact, expands the vulnerable
                                surface for attacks, it clearly nullifies the impact of an organization.&nbsp;Speed gets massively enhanced with the help of edge computing as it reduces the amount of latency. For example, autonomous vehicles require faster
                                processing of data since every millisecond matters on the roads matters. By confining data analysis to the edge, the speed of processing the data can be massively improved. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Edge computing reduces the cost
                                of retaining the data significantly by categorizing each data from the management perspective. As data can be retained in edge locations, it significantly reduces the bandwidth cost and all but eliminates the redundant storage.
                                &nbsp;As of now, edge computing is being fueled by the<a href="https://www.mobileappdaily.com/what-is-iot-and-how-iot-works">&nbsp;rapid evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT)</a>&nbsp;and in the future, it will create an
                                unstructured architecture over a set of distributed cloud services. For instance, we have drones that directly communicate with the enterprise IoT platform and conduct peer-to-peer exchanges. One such example is the latest
